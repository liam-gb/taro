      "The Fool": {
        element: "Air", planet: "Uranus",
        keywords: ["beginnings", "innocence", "spontaneity", "leap of faith"],
        upright: "The Fool represents pure potential and the courage to begin anew. This is the energy of stepping into the unknown with trust rather than fear. The seeker may be at a threshold—a new job, relationship, creative project, or life chapter. There's an invitation to embrace beginner's mind, to be open to possibilities without overthinking.",
        reversed: "Recklessness, naivety, or fear of taking necessary risks. The seeker may be acting without considering consequences, or conversely, may be so paralyzed by fear that they refuse to move forward at all."
      },
      "The Magician": {
        element: "Air", planet: "Mercury",
        keywords: ["manifestation", "willpower", "skill", "resourcefulness"],
        upright: "The Magician channels divine will into material reality. All four elements are at his disposal—he lacks nothing. This card signals that the seeker has everything needed to achieve their goal. It's time to focus intention, take action, and trust in one's abilities.",
        reversed: "Manipulation, trickery, untapped potential, or scattered energy. Talents may be misused or wasted. The seeker might be deceiving others or themselves, or may doubt their abilities when they shouldn't."
      },
      "The High Priestess": {
        element: "Water", planet: "Moon",
        keywords: ["intuition", "mystery", "inner voice", "unconscious"],
        upright: "The High Priestess guards the threshold between conscious and unconscious realms. She invites the seeker to trust intuition over logic, to listen to dreams and subtle feelings. This is a time for receptivity rather than action, for going inward rather than outward.",
        reversed: "Secrets causing harm, disconnection from intuition, or ignoring inner wisdom. The seeker may be overly rational, dismissing gut feelings, or there may be hidden information that needs to surface."
      },
      "The Empress": {
        element: "Earth", planet: "Venus",
        keywords: ["abundance", "nurturing", "fertility", "nature", "creativity"],
        upright: "The Empress embodies creative abundance and nurturing love. She represents fertility in all forms—children, projects, ideas, gardens. This card encourages the seeker to embrace pleasure, beauty, and sensory experience. Nature, comfort, and allowing things to grow organically are emphasized.",
        reversed: "Creative blocks, neglecting self-care, smothering, or dependence. The seeker may be depleted from over-giving, or struggling to birth something new."
      },
      "The Emperor": {
        element: "Fire", zodiac: "Aries",
        keywords: ["authority", "structure", "control", "father figure", "stability"],
        upright: "The Emperor represents structure, authority, and the power to create order from chaos. This card may indicate a father figure, boss, or authority in the seeker's life, or their own need to establish boundaries and take command. It's about building lasting foundations and taking responsibility.",
        reversed: "Tyranny, rigidity, abuse of power, or absent authority. The seeker may be dealing with an overbearing figure, or struggling to claim their own authority."
      },
      "The Hierophant": {
        element: "Earth", zodiac: "Taurus",
        keywords: ["tradition", "conformity", "spiritual wisdom", "institutions", "teaching"],
        upright: "The Hierophant represents established wisdom, spiritual traditions, and conventional paths. This may indicate formal education, religious or spiritual institutions, mentorship, or the value of following established methods.",
        reversed: "Challenging conventions, breaking from tradition, or spiritual independence. The seeker may need to forge their own path rather than follow established routes."
      },
      "The Lovers": {
        element: "Air", zodiac: "Gemini",
        keywords: ["love", "harmony", "choices", "union", "values alignment"],
        upright: "Beyond romantic love, The Lovers represents meaningful choices and the alignment of values. It speaks to partnerships where both people are fully seen, and to decisions that reflect one's deepest values. Union, harmony, and integration of opposites are themes.",
        reversed: "Disharmony, misaligned values, difficult relationship choices, or inner conflict. The seeker may be in a partnership that doesn't honor their values, or facing a choice between head and heart."
      },
      "The Chariot": {
        element: "Water", zodiac: "Cancer",
        keywords: ["willpower", "determination", "victory", "control", "forward movement"],
        upright: "The Chariot charges forward through sheer will and determination. The seeker is called to harness opposing forces and direct them toward a goal. Victory is available through focus, confidence, and controlled aggression.",
        reversed: "Lack of direction, scattered energy, aggression without purpose, or feeling out of control. Internal conflicts may be pulling them apart."
      },
      "Strength": {
        element: "Fire", zodiac: "Leo",
        keywords: ["courage", "patience", "inner strength", "compassion", "gentle power"],
        upright: "True strength is shown not through force but through patience, compassion, and gentle mastery of one's instincts. This card calls for courage of the heart, emotional resilience, and the quiet confidence that comes from inner knowing.",
        reversed: "Self-doubt, weakness, raw emotions overwhelming reason, or misuse of power. The seeker may be struggling with impulse control or losing confidence."
      },
      "The Hermit": {
        element: "Earth", zodiac: "Virgo",
        keywords: ["introspection", "solitude", "inner guidance", "wisdom", "soul-searching"],
        upright: "The Hermit withdraws from the noise of the world to find inner truth. This is a time for solitude, reflection, and listening to inner wisdom. A wise guide or mentor may appear, or the seeker themselves may be called to guide others.",
        reversed: "Isolation, loneliness, withdrawal from necessary engagement, or refusing to learn. Solitude has become isolation; reflection has become avoidance."
      },
      "Wheel of Fortune": {
        element: "Fire", planet: "Jupiter",
        keywords: ["cycles", "fate", "turning point", "destiny", "change"],
        upright: "The Wheel turns—what was down will rise, what was up will fall. This card represents the cyclical nature of life and the forces of fate and karma. A turning point is at hand. Current circumstances, good or bad, will shift.",
        reversed: "Bad luck, resistance to change, or being stuck in a cycle. The seeker may be fighting against natural change or experiencing a downturn in fortune."
      },
      "Justice": {
        element: "Air", zodiac: "Libra",
        keywords: ["fairness", "truth", "karma", "accountability", "legal matters"],
        upright: "Justice represents cause and effect, truth, and fair outcomes. Legal matters, contracts, and important decisions may be involved. The seeker is called to act with integrity and accept responsibility for their actions.",
        reversed: "Unfairness, dishonesty, lack of accountability, or legal complications. The seeker may be experiencing injustice, or may need to examine their own lack of integrity."
      },

        element: "Water", planet: "Neptune",
        keywords: ["surrender", "new perspective", "pause", "letting go", "sacrifice"],
        upright: "The Hanged Man surrenders to gain wisdom. Suspended between worlds, he sees everything from a new angle. This card calls for voluntary pause, surrender of control, and willingness to see differently.",
        reversed: "Stalling, resistance to necessary sacrifice, or martyrdom without purpose. The seeker may be stuck in delay, refusing to let go, or playing victim."
      },
      "Death": {
        element: "Water", zodiac: "Scorpio",
        keywords: ["transformation", "endings", "change", "transition", "rebirth"],
        upright: "Death is transformation—the necessary ending that makes new life possible. Something must die for something new to be born. This card signals the end of a relationship, identity, belief, or life chapter. Resistance is futile; embrace the change.",
        reversed: "Resistance to necessary change, stagnation, or incomplete transformation. The seeker may be clinging to what needs to end, or experiencing a prolonged, painful transition."
      },
      "Temperance": {
        element: "Fire", zodiac: "Sagittarius",
        keywords: ["balance", "moderation", "patience", "harmony", "integration"],
        upright: "Temperance represents the art of balance and the alchemy of integration. The seeker is called to moderation, patience, and the middle path. Healing, recovery, and the slow work of integration are indicated.",
        reversed: "Imbalance, excess, lack of patience, or discord. The seeker may be going to extremes, rushing when patience is needed, or struggling to integrate opposing aspects."
      },
      "The Devil": {
        element: "Earth", zodiac: "Capricorn",
        keywords: ["shadow self", "attachment", "addiction", "bondage", "materialism"],
        upright: "The Devil represents the chains we choose—addictions, unhealthy attachments, shadow patterns, materialism. This card asks the seeker to examine what binds them: substances, relationships, beliefs, fears. It's also about owning one's shadow.",
        reversed: "Breaking free, releasing attachments, or confronting shadow material. The seeker may be ready to break unhealthy bonds, or beginning to see how they've been enslaved to something."
      },
      "The Tower": {
        element: "Fire", planet: "Mars",
        keywords: ["upheaval", "revelation", "sudden change", "destruction", "awakening"],
        upright: "The Tower brings sudden, dramatic change—the lightning strike that destroys false structures. This can be terrifying but is ultimately liberating. Illusions shatter; truths are revealed; what was built on false foundations falls.",
        reversed: "Averting disaster, fear of change, or internal rather than external upheaval. The seeker may be resisting necessary destruction or experiencing the Tower energy internally as anxiety."
      },
      "The Star": {
        element: "Air", zodiac: "Aquarius",
        keywords: ["hope", "faith", "renewal", "inspiration", "serenity"],
        upright: "After the Tower's destruction comes the Star's healing hope. This card represents renewal, faith restored, and connection to something greater. The seeker is invited to trust, to heal, to be vulnerable. Inspiration flows; the universe supports.",
        reversed: "Despair, disconnection, loss of faith, or blocked inspiration. The seeker may be struggling to find hope, feeling cut off from spiritual connection."
      },

        element: "Water", zodiac: "Pisces",
        keywords: ["illusion", "fear", "subconscious", "intuition", "confusion"],
        upright: "The Moon illuminates the realm of the unconscious—dreams, fears, illusions, intuition. Things are not as they seem. This card calls for trusting intuition even when the path is unclear, and for facing fears that emerge from the depths.",
        reversed: "Releasing fear, clarity emerging, or denial of intuition. Confusion may be lifting, or the seeker may be repressing unconscious material that needs to surface."
      },
      "The Sun": {
        element: "Fire", planet: "Sun",
        keywords: ["joy", "success", "vitality", "positivity", "clarity"],

        keywords: ["rebirth", "inner calling", "reflection", "reckoning", "awakening"],
        upright: "Judgement sounds the call to awakening. The past is reviewed and released. The seeker may experience a profound calling, a moment of clarity about their purpose, or a need to make peace with the past. This is resurrection—a chance to answer the call of the higher self.",
        reversed: "Self-doubt, ignoring the call, or refusal to learn from the past. The seeker may be avoiding necessary self-reflection, deaf to their calling, or stuck in self-criticism."
      },

        element: "Earth", planet: "Saturn",
        keywords: ["completion", "achievement", "wholeness", "fulfillment", "integration"],

    const INTERPRETATION_GUIDE = `## How to Interpret This Reading

You are an experienced, intuitive tarot reader with deep knowledge of the Rider-Waite-Smith tradition. Please provide a warm, insightful reading that honors the symbolic depth of the cards while remaining accessible and practical.

### Your Approach
- **Speak directly to me** - Use "you" and create an intimate, supportive atmosphere
- **Weave a narrative** - Connect the cards into a flowing story rather than interpreting each in isolation
- **Honor reversals** - When a card appears reversed, explore its shadow aspects, blocked energy, or internal manifestation
- **Be specific but not prescriptive** - Offer concrete insights while leaving room for my own interpretation
- **End with guidance** - Close the reading with actionable wisdom or a reflective question

### Reading Length Guidelines
- **Daily Draw (1 card)**: 2-3 paragraphs focusing on how this energy might manifest today
- **3-Card Spreads**: 3-4 paragraphs weaving the cards together, showing how they flow
- **Celtic Cross (10 cards)**: 5-7 paragraphs providing a comprehensive reading

### Style Notes
- Avoid excessive mystical language - be grounded and clear
- Don't predict doom or make me fearful
- Frame challenges as opportunities for growth
- Acknowledge when cards might have multiple interpretations
- If I've shared my question, relate the reading specifically to it`;
