        "action": "Take the leap. Act with trust rather than certainty. Overthinking will paralyze—move before you're ready. The action required is beginning, not perfecting.",
        "outcome": "This leads to new beginnings. Whatever happens, a fresh chapter opens. The outcome is a threshold, not a conclusion. One journey ends as another starts.",
