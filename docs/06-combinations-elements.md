# Card Combinations & Elemental Dignities

This reference covers how cards interact with each other—both through elemental relationships and through common meaningful pairings.

---

## Elemental Dignities

The four suits correspond to four elements that interact in predictable ways:

| Element | Suit | Quality |
|---------|------|---------|
| Fire | Wands | Active, creative, passionate |
| Water | Cups | Emotional, intuitive, flowing |
| Air | Swords | Mental, communicative, cutting |
| Earth | Pentacles | Material, practical, stable |

### Element Interactions

**Friendly Pairs (strengthen each other):**
- **Fire + Air**: Mutual enhancement. Fire needs air to burn; ideas fuel passion. Wands + Swords = inspired action, powerful communication, plans that ignite.
- **Water + Earth**: Mutual support. Water nourishes earth; earth contains water. Cups + Pentacles = emotional security, practical love, nurturing abundance.

**Neutral Pairs (independent energies):**
- **Fire + Earth**: Different but not opposed. Passion meets practicality. May indicate tension between dreams and reality, but can also ground inspiration.
- **Water + Air**: Different but not opposed. Emotion meets intellect. May indicate head-heart conflict, but can also bring emotional intelligence.

**Challenging Pairs (weaken or conflict):**
- **Fire + Water**: Opposition. Fire evaporates water; water extinguishes fire. Wands + Cups = passion vs. emotion, action vs. feeling, drive vs. intuition.
- **Air + Earth**: Opposition. Air erodes earth; earth stifles air. Swords + Pentacles = ideas vs. practicality, theory vs. application, mental vs. material.

### Applying Elemental Dignities

When two cards appear together:
- **Same element**: Energy is amplified, focused, possibly excessive
- **Friendly elements**: Energies support and enhance each other
- **Neutral elements**: Energies operate independently, offering different perspectives
- **Opposing elements**: Tension, conflict, or need for balance between opposing forces
