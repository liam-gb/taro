Past: The High Priestess (upright)\n   Keywords: intuition, mystery, inner voice, unconscious\n   Base meaning: Guardian of the threshold between conscious and unconscious. Trust intuition over logic, listen to dreams and subtle knowing. Receptivity over action, going inward over outward. Hidden knowledge waiting to surface. The answers exist within, not without.\n   Position context: You once knew something without knowing how. That intuition\u2014trusted or ignored\u2014shaped the path to here. The inner voice spoke; what did you do with it?\n\n2. Present: Six of Pentacles (reversed)\n   Keywords: harmony, communication, transition\n   Base meaning: Meaning not available\n   Position context: Right now generosity is troubled. Either giving is controlling, receiving is shaming, or resources flow inappropriately. The Six's balance is off.\n\n3. Hidden Influences: Seven of Pentacles (reversed)\n   Keywords: reflection, assessment, perseverance\n   Base meaning: Meaning not available\n   Position context: A hidden factor frustrates cultivation. Something not visible blocks growth or prevents assessment. Secret obstacles shape the Seven's troubles.\n\n4. Obstacles: Temperance (upright)\n   Keywords: balance, moderation, patience, harmony\n   Base meaning: Balance and the alchemy of integration. Moderation, patience, the middle path. Healing, recovery, slow work of combining opposites. Flow between extremes. What seems contradictory can be blended. Time and patience transform through gentle mixing.\n   Position context: The obstacle is imbalance. What blocks you involves extremes, impatience, or inability to integrate.\n\n5. External Influences: Queen of Swords (reversed)\n   Keywords: nurturing, intuitive, mastery\n   Base meaning: Meaning not available\n   Position context: Outside influences trouble clarity. Someone uses truth cruelly, or circumstances prevent honest assessment. External forces distort the Queen's wisdom.\n\n6. Advice: Two of Wands (reversed)\n   Keywords: balance, partnership, duality\n   Base meaning: Meaning not available\n   Position context: Choose anyway. Fear of wrong choice isn't better than no choice. The guidance is to move past paralysis.\n\n7. Outcome: Ten of Swords (reversed)\n   Keywords: completion, ending, fulfillment\n   Base meaning: Meaning not available\n   Position context: This leads to results of how ending is handled. The outcome shows either recovery after devastation or consequences of resisted conclusion.\n\nElemental Balance: Balanced\nWater \u2192 Earth \u2192 Earth \u2192 Fire \u2192 Air \u2192 Fire \u2192 Air\n\nWeave these elements into a flowing interpretation (3-4 paragraphs).
