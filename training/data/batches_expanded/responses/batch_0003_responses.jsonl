The challenge is receiving self-created abundance. The Nine's prosperity requires letting yourself enjoy what you've built. The work is receiving the fruit of your effort. Looking to your past, Seven of Cups (upright) reveals the foundation from which you've grown. A time of many choices and fantasies shaped your path. Perhaps you chose wisely among options, perhaps you got lost in illusion. That experience with possibility and fantasy still influences how you approach choices. Looking ahead, The Tower (reversed) suggests what awaits. Ahead lies either prevented collapse or internal upheaval. What's coming involves disaster averted or anxiety about what might fall. In its reversed position, this card asks you to look at where this energy may be blocked or inverted in your life. Above you, representing your highest potential, The Star (upright) appears. Your highest possibility is complete renewal. The best outcome involves fully embracing hope and healing. Aim for the Star's serene faith.\n\nBeneath the surface, Wheel of Fortune (upright) reveals unconscious influences. Beneath this situation lies fate and karma. Unconscious patterns in the larger cycle shape everything above. The King of Cups (reversed) offers this advice. Examine your emotional authority. Are you suppressing or collapsing? The guidance is healing whatever troubles the King's genuine mastery of feeling. In its reversed position, this card asks you to look at where this energy may be blocked or inverted in your life. External influences are shown by Page of Cups (reversed). Outside influences trouble emotional development. Circumstances either close the heart or encourage emotional immaturity. External forces block the Page. In its reversed position, this card asks you to look at where this energy may be blocked or inverted in your life. Your hopes and fears are reflected in Nine of Cups (upright). You hope for lasting satisfaction and fear it won't endure or isn't deserved. The contentment feels both welcome and precarious. You want fulfillment but doubt it's real. As a potential outcome, Ten of Wands (reversed) shows where this path may lead. This leads to consequences of released or shirked burden. The result depends on whether release was wise or irresponsible. In its reversed position, this card asks you to look at where this energy may be blocked or inverted in your life.\n\nWhat you are building has meaning because you choose to give it meaning. The foundations you lay now will support future growth. Take one intentional step today toward creating the life and connections you envision."}
